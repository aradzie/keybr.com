It's the smartest way to learn touch typing and improve your typing speed.
On the surface it looks pretty simple, it shows you a piece of text, you type it out.
The devil is in the details, keybr.com has a few unique features.

* keybr.com tracks every single key press and computes statistics for each individual keyboard key.
* It automatically generates lessons focusing on your weakest keys.
* It allows you to set your own target typing speed and tracks your progress toward this goal.
* It starts with a small list of the most frequent letters of your language.
* It adds more letters later when you reach the target speed with the previous letters.
* It can predict future and tell you how many more lessons to complete to reach the target speed.
* It shows you a beautiful profile page with lots of graphs and the details about your learning progress. 
* It has plenty of modes and configuration options.
